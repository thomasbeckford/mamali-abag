### Steps to init client side:

1.  `yarn`

2.  `yarn dev`

### Tech Stack:

- MUI latest
- React latest
- Typescript
- NextJS
- Eslint / Prettier / husky / lint-staged config

## Things that can be improved:

- Use chakra or mantine

- Add tests

- Create a custom hook for localstorage (if needed), or use a persist tool for state managment

- We can add a loader component for ethereums requests

- We can use Material UI for styling correctly dropdowns

- Split up the code into smaller components

- We can use a better way to handle errors

- Probably the design is not pixel perfect, but it works well enough for now

- Make a better organization for components, maybe using atomic design principles as figma does

- Creating breakpoints for tablet

- Change SX styling for dropdowns

- Change some SX styling for mui theme styles, create more variants, or add makeStyles on each component
